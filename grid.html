      <h2>Octonauts is a children's television series</h2>
      <p>The show follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized anthropomorphic animals, a team of eight
        adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from which they go on undersea adventures with the help
        of
        a fleet of aquatic vehicles. Although its technology is fictional, the exotic creatures and locations that the
        crew encounter are based on real marine animals in their natural habitats. </p>
      <h3>Main characters</h3>
      <p><strong>Barnacles</strong> is the brave polar bear captain of the Octonauts. He knows how to drive any
        vehicle
        and is strong enough to lift a giant clam. however, despite his bravery, it was revealed in The Caves of Sac
        Actun
        that he was claustrophobic. Catchphrases: "Octonauts, let's do this", "Sound the Octo-Alert!", "Octonauts, to
        the
        launch bay!" and "Hold on, this could get bumpy".</p>
      <h3>Vegimals</h3>
      <p>Vegimals are half-animal, half-vegetable creatures. The vegimals were discovered by Shellington as eggs
        attached
        to the side of the Octopod. To protect them he brought them into his lab, where they hatched a few days later.
        After a few weeks, they established themselves as an integral part of the crew.[5][6] They primarily speak
        Vegimalese, a language made of chirps and warbles (heavily accented English with inter-mixed gibberish),
        though
        they also speak a limited amount of English (with an accent). Shellington is the only (non-vegimal) Octonaut
        who
        has some fluency in Vegimalese.</p>
